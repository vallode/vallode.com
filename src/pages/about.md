Hey! I'm Mariusz, a full-stack developer, tinkerer, and hobbyist. I love
creating a more efficient and accessible web for all. Here you'll find all
my ramblings, projects, and miscellaneous bits.

I enjoy working in public, sharing my projects as far out as possible. One
of my first web-related interests was the creation of [startpages](/startpages), a community I still maintain close contact with over a decade later.

This website is built using [Astro](//astro.build) (via [Deno](//deno.com)), hosted on [Cloudflare](//cloudflare.com), and uses [Bye Bye Binary's](//byebyebinary.space) [Nudles](//typotheque.genderfluid.space/fr/fontes/nudles) font. Icons from [Iconoir](//iconoir.com). Everything is [open-source](//github.com/vallode/vallode.com).
